Subject: {CLUBNAME} - Added to easy-Speak at {SERVER_NAME}

<font face="Verdana" size="2" color=#2F2F2F>
<br>Hi {TO_NAME},
<br>
<br>I added <a href="{SERVER_URL}/portal.php?page=1&c={CLUB_ID}">{CLUBNAME}</a> to {SITENAME} for you.
<br>
<br>The agenda templates may not be an exact match so you might want to add some meeting roles and shuffle things around a bit.
<br>
<br>Once you have the agenda looking the way that you want you should then then save it ready to use in future.
<br>
<br>You can add as many meeting roles as you need in the Club Control Panel and then use them in the agendas as required.
<br>
<br>All system permissions are personal and given to the club officers for the year - so please make sure that any username you create is something personal to avoid confusion in subsequent years
<br>
<br>You will be able to add your club members and the rest of the committee by uploading a spreadsheet yourself (below).
<br><i>Adding the members this way is 'silent' - they are not advised of usernames and passwords until you tell them in an initial training session (so make sure that you keep a note of those passwords!)</i>
<br>
<br>We provide each club with a website including all the Social Media links etc. and where a good many of the pages are updated automatically.
<br>To get you going we we start you with six-page site that you may edit on the page, add new pages and move the items around with drag-and-drop technology.
<br><a href="{SERVER_URL}/kb.php?mode=article&k=208">Instructions for managing that are here.</a>
<br>
<br>We are developing a series of training video to help club members and new club officers to get the best use of the software.
<br>
<br>The first phase of this is made up of some short video for club members
<br>which are <a href="http://easy-speak.org/portal.php?page=130">available via YouTube here</a>
<br>
<br>There is an excellent  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik_7uw-l8j8&feature=youtu.be">introduction for club members here.</a>
<br>
<br>Contact Coach Carole in D73 coachcarole70@gmail.com who can provide assistance for your easy-Speak learning - self-enrol in her easy-Speak Made Easy course!

<br>
<!-- <br>District 59 also provide several webinars in English. <a href="http://district59.eu/portal.php?page=2117">Details here</a>-->
<br>We are in the process of creating new training video <a href=http://www.youtube.com/user/easySpeaksupport>-- you may view the progress so far on YouTube here</a>
<br>
<br>It will be a big timesaver for you to chat with the VPE of a <a href="{SERVER_URL}/neardata.php">local club using the system.</a>
<br>
<br>You should find everything you need in the <a href="{SERVER_URL}/kbmap.php">Knowledgebase.</a>
<br>Help Options > Knowledgemap from the menu bar gives a table of contents and
<br>is a great way of exploring the articles that are there:
<br>
<br>These articles in the Knowledgebase will help you to get started:
<br><a href="{SERVER_URL}/kb.php?mode=cat&cat=21">Getting started on easy-Speak:</a>

<br><a href="{SERVER_URL}/kb.php?mode=article&k=43">Importing Member details from a spreadsheet</a>
<br>You can also create your memberlist by uploading the XLS file 'Club Roster' that any Club officer can get direct from Club Central at toastmasters.org.
<br>
<br>Don't be shy to <b>ask questions</b> about using the system in the discussion forum <a href="{SERVER_URL}/viewforum.php?f=4">"How do I ...?"</a>
<br>If you have <b>suggestions</b> on how we can improve easy-Speak <a href="{SERVER_URL}/viewforum.php?f=23"> "please make them here."</a>
<br>...and if you think you found a <b>bug</b>, please <a href="{SERVER_URL}/viewforum.php?f=7"> "report the problem"</a>
<br>
<br>(To get access to the Club Control Panel - there is a small link at
<br>the very bottom of the screen, just above the security logo.
<br>You must be logged in to your own club to get access.)

<br>
<br>The system will remind the member, their mentor and the VPE of any meeting
<br>roles that may be used for CL. You will need to get the history loaded to make that
<br>reliable but, if the Club uses <a href="{SERVER_URL}/kb.php?mode=article&k=154">the Leadership Chart</a> as a tool, it's worth the effort.
<br>
<br>Please let me know how you get on.
