VPE, Meeting Manager - Wondering why a certain item won't print on the Summary agenda? Use the edit_agenda button and check the print settings for that item.
Contest Time - Did you know that you can hide the names of Judges? Just make sure that you have the correct setting for that role in the Club Control Panel and the only people to see the names will be officers with permission to assign the roles for that meeting.
Wondering why your regular Club meeting says 'Contest' at the top of the view_meeting screen? It's because the agenda includes a role that you have defined as 'Contest Only'. Vote Counter is a popular one to get wrong - if your club uses a Vote Couter at every meeting you should go into the Club Control Panel and change the role so that it is NOT 'Contest Only'
What's the difference in presentation on the screen and printed agenda between a contest and a regular Club Meeting? Speech details are always hidden for a contest, so your club members may make a manual speech and have a written evaluation but the audience will never know that.
